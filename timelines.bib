Chapter 6 describes some OWL constructs such as hasValue Restrictions and Enumerated classes, which aren t directly used in the main tutorial.

to corpus evidence for semantic and syntactic generalizations, and (b)
the representat
ion of the valences of its target words (mostly nouns, adjectives, and
verbs) in which the semantic portion makes use of frame semantics. The
resulting datab
ase will contain (a) descriptions of the semantic frames underlying the
meanings of the words described, and (b) the valence representation
(semantic and syn
tactic) of several thousand words and phrases, each accompanied by (c) a
representative collection of annotated corpus attestations, which
jointly exemplify 
the observed linkings between "frame elements" and their syntactic
realizations (e.g. grammatical function, phrase type, and other
syntactic traits). This re

release of WEKA. In that time, the software has been rewritten entirely
from scratch, evolved substantially and now accompanies a text on data

academia and business, has an active community, and has been downloaded
more than 1.4 million times since being placed on Source-Forge in April

the history of the project, and, in light of the recent 3.6 stable

  abstract = {This paper presents a new approach for measuring semantic
similarity/distance between words and concepts. It combines a lexical
taxonomy structure with corpus statistical information so that the
semantic distance between nodes in the semantic space constructed by the
taxonomy can be better quantified with the computational evidence
derived from a distributional analysis of corpus data. Specifically, the
proposed measure is a combined approach that inherits the edge-based
approach of the edge counting scheme, which is then enhanced by the
node-based approach of the information content calculation. When tested
on a common data set of word pair similarity ratings, the proposed
approach outperforms other computational models. It gives the highest
correlation value (r = 0.828) with a benchmark based on human similarity
judgements, whereas an upper bound (r = 0.885) is observed when human
subjects replicate the same task.},

@article{Punyakanok2008Importance,
    abstract = {{We present a general framework for semantic role labeling. The framework combines a machine-learning technique with an integer linear programming-based inference procedure, which incorporates linguistic and structural constraints into a global decision process. Within this framework, we study the role of syntactic parsing information in semantic role labeling. We show that full syntactic parsing information is, by far, most relevant in identifying the argument, especially, in the very first stage---the pruning stage. Surprisingly, the quality of the pruning stage cannot be solely determined based on its recall and precision. Instead, it depends on the characteristics of the output candidates that determine the difficulty of the downstream problems. Motivated by this observation, we propose an effective and simple approach of combining different semantic role labeling systems through joint inference, which significantly improves its performance. Our system has been evaluated in the CoNLL-2005 shared task on semantic role labeling, and achieves the highest F1 score among 19 participants.}},

    abstract = {{Abstract A universal property of natural language is that every language is able to express negation. Every l
anguage has some device at its disposal to reverse the truth value of a certain sentence. However, languages may differ to qui
te a large extent as to how they express this negation. Not only do languages vary with respect to the position of negative el
ements, also the form of negative elements and the interpretation of sentences that consist of multiple negative elements are 
subject to broad cross-linguistic variation. The study to the behaviour of sentential negation has therefore strongly been gui
ded by the question as to what determines the possible ways that sentential negation can manifest itself. A conclusion of the 
article will be that the behaviour of negation in natural language strongly deviates from what intuitively might be expected.}

@article{Lobner2000Polarity,
    abstract = {{The present paper is an attempt at the investigation of the nature of polarity contrast in natural languages.
 Truth conditions for natural language sentences are incomplete unless they include a proper definition of the conditions unde
r which they are false. It is argued that the tertium non datur principle of classical bivalent logical systems is empirically
 invalid for natural languages: falsity cannot be equated with non-truth. Lacking a direct intuition about the conditions unde
r which a sentence is false, we need an independent foundation of the concept of falsity. The solution I offer is a definition
 of falsity in terms of the truth of a syntactic negation of the sentence. A definition of syntactic negation is proposed for 
English (Section 1).  The considerations are applied to the analysis of definites in non-generic sentences and the analysis of
 generic indefinites. These two domains are investigated in breadth and some depth and the analyses compared and connected. Du
ring the discussion of non-generic predications with definite arguments and their respective negations (Section 2), a theory o
f predication is developed, basic to which is the distinction between integrative and summative predication. Summative predica
tion, e.g., distributive plural, leads to contrary, all-or-no-thing, polarity contrasts due to the fundamental Presupposition 
of Indivisibility. Further-more, levels of predication are distinguished that are built up by various processes of constructin
g macropredications from lexical predicates. Given this analysis, particular (i.e., non-generic) quantification (Section 3) ca
n be reanalyzed as an integrative, first-order form of predication that fills the truth-value gaps created by summative predic
ation. The account comprises both nominal and adverbial quantification and relates quantification to the simpler types of pred
ication discussed in Section 2.    An analogous line of argumentation is developed in Section 4 for indefinite generics (and s
imilar constructions, including donkey-sentences) and generic quantification. that the generality of simple generic predicatio
ns is not due to any quantification.It is argued elements, but results from the lack of referential anchoring of argument term
s. In Section 5, the results are linked to pragmatic and cognitive considerations about the role of polarization in natural la
nguage communication, explaining the varying degrees of rigidity characteristic for different types of predications and quanti
fications.    The discussion leads to the conclusion that the type of polarity contrast is determined by the often complex typ
e of predication. Polarity contrast in natural language is not a uniform phenomenon, but locally constructed for each predicat
ion on the basis of a defined by the respective presuppositions of the predication.}},
